The traditional approaches for implementing event-based  Demand  Response  (DR)  have  been  static,  and  do  not involve  feedback  to  the  consumers  regardless  of  their  perfor-mance  during  the  DR  event.  This  may  however  lead  to  anincomplete  system-wide  response,  thereby  forcing  the  utility  toemploy  direct  load  control  to  achieve  the  required  response,or  buy  additional  generation  reserve  from  the  spot  market.  To mitigate  this  inefficiency,  this  paper  proposes  closing  the  loopthrough  an  incentive  control  for  residential  DR  participantsenabled using event stream monitoring. By realizing the latter inan  adaptive  and  distributed  manner,  the  data  communication and   computation overhead   involved   in   the   decision   makingprocess is reduced. With simple assumptions, it is demonstratedthat  methods  for  event  stream  processing  can  ensure  that  thescheduled  DR  is  achieved  completely.  Therefore,  the  proposed implementation allows for scalable, effective, privacy-preserving,and robust implementation of incentive-based residential DR thatensures  full  overall  compliance  to  the  DR  task.
